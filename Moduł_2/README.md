# Password Validator
Checks passwords from given text file with provided validators. 
Each password is being examined by criteria of length of itself, containing numbers, 
special characters, upper- and lowercase letters,
and if it passed validators until now, it is checked on haveibeenpwnd.com.
After all those steps, the password is considered as strong.
